# Voice Commands Guide 🎙️

Control the recipe cooking process hands-free using voice commands!

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  Tap the **Microphone Icon** 🎙️ in the recipe instructions tab.
2.  The icon will turn **RED** to indicate it is listening.
3.  Speak one of the commands below.
4.  The app will **stay listening** until you tap the microphone again to turn it off.

## 🗣️ Supported Commands

### ⏱️ Timer Controls (New!)
Control the timer for the current step:
*   **"Start Timer"** / **"Begin Timer"**: Starts the timer.
*   **"Stop Timer"** / **"Pause Timer"**: Pauses the timer.
*   **"Reset Timer"** / **"Restart Timer"**: Resets the timer to its original duration.

### ▶️ Playback
*   **"Play"** / **"Start"** / **"Read"**: Starts reading the current or next incomplete step.
*   **"Stop"** / **"Pause"**: Stops reading immediately.

### ⏭️ Navigation
*   **"Next"**: Skips to and reads the next instruction.
*   **"Step [Number]"**: Jumps to a specific step (e.g., *"Step 3"*).

## 💡 Tips
*   **Continuous Listening**: The app now listens continuously. You can say "Read", then "Stop", then "Start timer" without touching the screen.
*   **Timers**: Timer commands apply to the step currently being read. If no step is active, it tries to find the next incomplete step with a timer.
*   Tap the microphone icon anytime to toggle listening **On/Off**.
